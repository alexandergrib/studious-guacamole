                            <p>Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. Cancer starts when cells
                                begin
                                to
                                grow out of control. Breast cancer cells usually form a tumor that can often be seen on
                                an
                                x-ray or felt
                                as a lump. Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women, but men can get breast cancer,
                                too. </p>
                            <p>It’s important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer
                                (malignant).
                                They are not life threatening, but some types of benign breast lumps can increase a
                                woman's
                                risk of
                                getting breast cancer.</p>
                            <p>Any breast lump or change needs to be checked by a health care
                                professional to
                                determine if it is benign or malignant (cancer) and if it might affect your future

                            <p>Breast cancers can start from different parts of the breast.
                                Most breast cancers begin in the ducts that carry milk to the nipple (ductal cancers)
                                Some start in the glands that make breast milk (lobular cancers).</p>
                            <p>There are also other types of breast cancer that are less common like phyllodes tumor and
                                angiosarcoma
                                A small number of cancers start in other tissues in the breast. These cancers are called
                                sarcomas and
                                lymphomas and are not really thought of as breast cancers.</p>
                            <p>Although many types of breast cancer can cause a lump in the breast, not all do. See

                                also found on screening mammograms, which can detect cancers at an earlier stage, often

                                There's no right or wrong way to check your breasts. But it's important to know how
                                your
                                breasts usually look and feel. That way, you can spot any changes quickly and report
                                them to
                                a GP.</p>
                            <p>The <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/breast-screening-mammogram/" target=_blank
                                    rel="noreferrer">NHS Breast Screening Programme</a> has produced a
                                <ul>5-point plan for being breast aware:</p>

                            <li>look at your breasts and feel them</li>
                            <li>know what changes to look for</li>
                            <li>report any changes to a GP without delay</li>
                            <li>attend routine screening if you're aged 50 to 70</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Look at your breasts and feel each breast and armpit, and up to your collarbone. You may
                                find it easiest to do this in the shower or bath, by running a soapy hand over each
                                breast
                                and up under each armpit.</p>

                            <p>You can also look at your breasts in the mirror. Look with your arms by your side and

                                <p>See a GP if you notice any of the following changes:</p>

                                <li>a change in the size, outline or shape of your breast</li>
                                <li>a change in the look or feel of the skin on your breast, such as puckering or
                                    dimpling,
                                    a rash or redness</li>
                                <li>a new lump, swelling, thickening or bumpy area in one breast or armpit that was not
                                    there before</li>
                                <li>a discharge of fluid from either of your nipples</li>
                                <li>any change in nipple position, such as your nipple being pulled in or pointing
                                    differently</li>
                                <li>a rash (like eczema), crusting, scaly or itchy skin or redness on or around your
                                    nipple
                                </li>
                                <li>any discomfort or pain in one breast, particularly if it's a new pain and does not
                                    go
                                    away (although pain is only a symptom of breast cancer in rare cases)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Breast changes can happen for many reasons, and most of them are not serious. Lots of
                                women have breast lumps, and most breast lumps are not cancerous.</p>

                            <p>However, if you find changes in your breast that are not normal for you, it's best to see
                                a GP as soon as possible. This is because it's important to rule out breast cancer. If
                                cancer is detected, then appropriate treatment should be planned as quickly as possible.

                                        including your
                                        overall health and personal preferences.</p>

                                    <p>Some treatments are local, meaning they treat the tumor without affecting the
                                        rest of the
                                        body.
                                        Most women with breast cancer will have some type of surgery to remove the
                                        tumor. Depending
                                        on the type of breast cancer and how advanced it is, you might need other types
                                        of treatment
                                        as well, either before or after surgery, or sometimes both.</p>

                                    <p>Drugs used to treat breast cancer are considered systemic therapies because they
                                        can reach
                                        cancer cells almost anywhere in the body. They can be given by mouth or put
                                        directly into
                                        the bloodstream. Depending on the type of breast cancer, different types of drug
                                        treatment
                                        might be used, including: chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted drug therapy,
