                Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. Cancer starts when cells begin to
                grow out of control. Breast cancer cells usually form a tumor that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt
                as a lump. Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women, but men can get breast cancer, too.
                It’s important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer (malignant).
                They are not life threatening, but some types of benign breast lumps can increase a woman's risk of
                getting breast cancer. Any breast lump or change needs to be checked by a health care professional to
                determine if it is benign or malignant (cancer) and if it might affect your future cancer risk.

                A risk factor is anything that increases your chances of getting a disease, such as cancer. While you can’t change
                some breast cancer risk factors—family history and aging, for example—there are some risk factors that
                you can control. 
                <h6>For all women</h6>
                <strong>Get to and stay at a healthy weight:</strong> Both increased body weight and weight gain as an
                adult are linked with a higher risk of breast cancer after menopause. Cancer Research UK
                recommends you stay at a healthy weight throughout your life and avoid excess weight gain by balancing
                your food intake with physical activity.
                <strong>Be physically active:</strong>Many studies have shown that moderate to vigorous physical
                activity is linked with lower breast cancer risk, so it’s important to get regular physical activity.
                <strong>Avoid or limit alcohol: </strong> Alcohol increases risk of breast cancer. Even low levels of
                alcohol intake have been linked with an increase in risk.

                Some factors are outside our control, including:
                Being a woman – 99% of new cases of breast cancer are in women.
                Getting older – 80% of breast cancers occur in women over the age of 50. Most men who get breast cancer
                are over 60.
                A family history of breast cancer – if you have a family history of breast cancer, you and some other
                members of your family may have a higher than average risk of developing the disease, however, there may
                be some ways you can manage your risk.

                The possible link between diet and breast cancer risk is not clear, but this is an active area of study.
                Some (but not all) studies have suggested that a diet that is high in vegetables, fruit, and
                calcium-rich dairy products, but low in red and processed meats might help lower the risk of breast
                cancer. It's also not clear if specific vegetables, fruits, or other foods can lower risk. And most
                studies have not found that lowering fat intake has much of an effect on breast cancer risk (although
                some have suggested it might help lower the risk of dying from breast cancer).

                But just because the science isn't clear on this doesn't mean that there’s no point in eating a healthy
                diet. A diet low in fat, processed and red meat, and sugary drinks, but high in fruits and vegetables
                can clearly have many health benefits, including lowering the risk of some other types of cancer.

                So far, there's no strong evidence that taking vitamins or any other type of dietary supplement reduces
                the risk of breast cancer.

                If you are a woman at increased risk for breast cancer (for instance, because you have a strong family
                history of breast cancer, a known gene mutation that increases breast cancer risk, such as in the BRCA1
                or BRCA2 gene, or you have had DCIS or LCIS), there are some things you can do that might help lower
                your chances of developing breast cancer (or help find it early).

                * Genetic counseling and testing for breast cancer risk (if it hasn’t been done already)
                * Close observation to look for early signs of breast cancer
                * Medicines to lower breast cancer risk
                * Preventive (prophylactic) surgery
                
                Your health care provider can help you determine your risk of breast cancer, as well as which, if any,
                of these options might be right for you.
