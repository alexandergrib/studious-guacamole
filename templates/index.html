                <p class="lead pt-3">Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women the UK with one woman
                    diagnosed every 10 minutes. It is the most commonly diagnosed cancer for women all over
                    the world. Researchers believe that developing breast cancer can be environmental or
                    genetic, or perhaps a combination of both; and they also agree that there are some risk
                    factors that cannot be changed, and preventing cancer entirely is impossible. However,
                    there are ways to be proactive by living a healthy lifestyle.</p>
